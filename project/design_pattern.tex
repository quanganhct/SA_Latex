\section{DESIGN PATTERNS}

\paragraph{}
In this project, I have used in total eleven design patterns. These patterns could be divided into three groups

\begin{itemize}
\item Creational: Singleton, Abstract Factory, Builder
\item Structural: Proxy, Composite, Decorator
\item Behavioral: Strategy, Observer, Iterator, Visitor, Template
\end{itemize}

Each of these patterns will be presented throughly in the next parts.
