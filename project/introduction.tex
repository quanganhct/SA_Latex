\section{INTRODUCTION}

\paragraph{}
In this project, we immitated a system that work for a travel agency. This system can book two main types of travel for the clients: travels without service and travels with services. Travel without service, means that the reservation is made only for the flight, where as travel with services allow a demand for checking in an hotel an renting a car.
