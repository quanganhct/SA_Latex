\section{STRUCTURAL PATTERNS}

\subsection{Proxy}
The purpose of Proxy pattern in our project is for hiding the real object. It will add security access to an original object. Any access to a real object would be examined by the proxy, and the proxy will decide if it's safe to delegate the request to the original object. 

\paragraph{}
There're three proxy in our program :
\begin{itemize}
\item ProxyClient
\item ProxyFlightTicket
\item ProxyHotelReservation
\end{itemize}
