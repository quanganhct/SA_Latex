\section{PROGRAM 'S SPECIFICATION OVERVIEW}

\subsection{Brief Introduction}

\paragraph{}
Our project 's purpose is to help a travel agency make a booking for clients. There're two kinds of service package supported

\begin{itemize}
\item Travel without service: consist of only flight's reservation
\item Travel with services: apart from flight's reservation, hotel's reservation and car renting could also be added
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
There're three kinds of flight's reservation

\begin{lstlisting}
public enum FlightTicketType {
	VIP, Normal, Pool
}
\end{lstlisting}
The \textit{Pool} ticket is the type of ticket proposed to the travel agency by a flight agency. The only difference between \textit{Pool} and \textit{Normal} is that \textit{Pool}'s price is cheaper than the other.

\paragraph{}
There're also three kinds of hotel's reservation

\begin{lstlisting}
public enum HotelServiceType {
	Cheap, Normal, Lux
}
\end{lstlisting}
