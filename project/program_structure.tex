\section{PROGRAM 'S SPECIFICATION OVERVIEW}

\subsection{Brief Introduction}

\paragraph{}
Our project 's purpose is to help a travel agency make a booking for clients. There're two kinds of service package supported

\begin{itemize}
\item Travel without service: consist of only flight's reservation
\item Travel with services: apart from flight's reservation, hotel's reservation and car renting could also be added
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
There're three kinds of flight's reservation

\begin{lstlisting}
public enum FlightTicketType {
	VIP, Normal, Pool
}
\end{lstlisting}
The \textit{Pool} ticket is the type of ticket proposed to the travel agency by a flight agency. The only difference between \textit{Pool} and \textit{Normal} is that \textit{Pool}'s price is cheaper than the other.

\paragraph{}
There're also three kinds of hotel's reservation

\begin{lstlisting}
public enum HotelServiceType {
	Cheap, Normal, Lux
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Software Usage}

The creation of a Travel's object could be done using class \textit{TravelBuilder}. In this class, there're two methods that can create a travel without service

\begin{lstlisting}
public Travel buildTravelNoServiceForOneClient(Client c, FlightTicketType type, CityName destination)
public Travel buildTravelNoServiceForGroup(Client c, FlightTicketType type, CityName destination)
\end{lstlisting}

When a client register a service, if there isn't any direct flight between the client's current city and the destination city, a transit flight will be added.  

\paragraph{}
For creating a travel with services, consist of only one trip, we could use

\begin{lstlisting}
public Travel buildTravelSimpleService(Client c, CityName destination, FlightTicketType f, HotelServiceType h)
\end{lstlisting}

For a touring service, a trip through many cities, we need two functions

\begin{lstlisting}
public Travel buildTravelTouringService(Client c, CityName destination, FlightTicketType f, HotelServiceType h)
public void addNextTour(TravelTouringService t, CityName destination, FlightTicketType f, HotelServiceType h)
\end{lstlisting}

The first one is for building the first
